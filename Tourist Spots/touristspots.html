            <h2>1. Magellan's Cross</h2>
            <p>
                Magellan’s Cross is one of Cebu’s most iconic landmarks and a symbol of the Philippines’ Christian beginnings. 
                Planted in 1521 by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, the cross commemorates the arrival of Christianity in the country. 
                Today, the cross is housed inside a small chapel beside the Basilica del Santo Niño, where thousands of visitors come to reflect, pray, 
                or simply marvel at its historical significance. It is considered a sacred relic, making it a must-visit for those who want to connect with Cebu’s religious heritage.
